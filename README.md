# JsShellExtended, a website framework?

Started out as fork of [francoisburdy/js-shell-emulator](https://github.com/francoisburdy/js-shell-emulator), but got a bit out of hand.

Is now the framework for my website [aldrian.cc](www.aldrian.cc), with all actual content explicitely not present in this repository. 

Feel free to poke around.
